### Comments

Nice work, this app is fully functional. Please note the code quality comments below.

----------------

Your viewDidLoad method in ViewController.swift is performing multiple different tasks.
This is a method where multiple tasks will happen, but we should split the code for those 
tasks into helper methods. Here's an example of how we could make this code more 
encapsulated and more readable:

Task 1: populateAnimalsArray() <- You've already done this one! Good job
Task 2: configureButtonsAndImageViews()

Now, viewDidLoad looks like this:

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
 
    // some miscellaneous small-task code

    populateAnimalsArray()
    configureButtonsAndImageViews()
}

Much cleaner! Note that the names of these methods tell you exactly what they do. That
indicates a method is well-named.

A second method that could benefit from splitting its functionality into helpers is the
buttonTapped method. How many distinct tasks is that method performing, and what would be
good names for the helper methods you can create?

----------------

On line 59 of your view controller, you write "for i in 0...2". This is static and non-
maintanable. We like to be as dynamic as possible in our coding. If another animal gets
added to the zoo, unless we remember to update this number, the 4th animal will never show
up. If an animal leaves the zoo, we have a much worse problem. The app would crash with
an index out-of-range error. How can we be more dynamic? Like this:

for i in 0..<animals.count {

OR

for (i, animal) in animals.enumerated() { 
// this tuple gives you both the Int i and the animal object at that index. Handy!

----------------

Careful with your newlines. You do a good job using them to segment your code into 
distinct "thoughts", but there should only ever be one empty newline at a time. For
instance, lines 41-45 of your view controller should be cut down to one line.

----------------

We camelCase in Swift, not snake_case.

All variables and methods, including IBOutlets and IBActions, start with a lowecaseLetter.
All classes, structs, and enums start with an UppercaseLetter.

----------------

Your view controller has all of it's sections in order, but please mark them.

// MARK: Properties

// MARK: Lifecycle

// MARK: Button Actions

// MARK: Scroll View Delegate

----------------

Lmk if you have any questions!
